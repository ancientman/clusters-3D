This pipeline analyzes ckusters of fluorophore labeled protein in the nuclei of _Drosophila_ embryos. The input files are wither in CZI format of in mutistack TIFF format. For CZI format files the pipeline uses bioformats. for positional data, the pipeline aslo expects an input image file showing the front and the rear end of the embryos.and calculates the absolute position of the embryo extremities using those.
